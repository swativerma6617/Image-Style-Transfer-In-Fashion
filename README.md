# How to Run Code

Packages may needed to be installed before running the script completely. The dataset used can be found below, images have been preloaded and you can demo our final VGG19 model by running the following:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
Then you will be prompted to select 
1. the content image
2. the style image 
from a list.


Four plots will be displayed one after the other once exiting each plot window before the code finishes running.
